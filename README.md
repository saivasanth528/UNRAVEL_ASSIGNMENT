# UNRAVEL_ASSIGNMENT
Merging of buckets

1) Generated the random data , maintaing the array list data structure for storing buckets 
2) Written the code for aggregation logic, using only buffer bucket instance for compaction, not creating new bucket every time.
3) Attached the screenshot for sample output
4) Output contains columns of start time, end time, CPU, Memory fields
5) Before aggregation showing n buckets, after aggregation displaying n/2 buckets, since they are compacted
6) The code can be extended to compaction of n buckets, but to keep the things simple, i have just considered two buckets
